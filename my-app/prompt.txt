the current appliction which is rendering documents on the basis of search query needs a ui enhancement and better looking. 
right now the page which is rendered @src/app/SearchTest/page.tsx when you enter your keywords shows documents metadata in cards form and there is a left sidebar for applying filters dynamically
the rendered page must have 2 views the one which i mentioned above would be the reader view and the other one which is grid view
when user clicks grid view the user when he clicks on grid view shows metadata of say 100 documents at once in a grid structure populating fields against row of documents
make a checkbox for selecting one or multiple documents 
when a checkbox is clicked it should open the document's metadata in side section or in pop up  mentioning its metadata ( populating fields against the values returned from es).... when user clicks on some other document the metadata of that document should be shown
these are the major fields in my es index
propId
ParentpropId
IsAttachment
SystemPath
Branch
DocType
Text
AttachmentPath
DocumentDate
DocumentFrom
DocumentTo
there are also more fields and in grid view you have to take all fields as column titles
also pagination mentioned 100 docs of say 21000 docs returns , going to next page option
i want you to change the header( which doesnt look good) and also other things to make the website look good visibly and clean
